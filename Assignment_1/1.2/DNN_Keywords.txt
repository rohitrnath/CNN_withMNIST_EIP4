1. Convolution
	Convolution in imageprocessig is a kind of correlatimg the image with kernal. This is to extract some specific features from image.

2. Filters
	Kernals are matrix or data structure, which is used for variety of image processing oprations by convolving kernal over the image.
	The convolution results high value if the kernal pattern available in the image space. In CNN, filters, kernals, feature extractor, all are having same meaning.

3. Epoch
	Its the one single pass(both forward and backward pass) of all the data through the network. 
	Repeating epochs adjust weights and gives more accuracy.

4. 1X1 Convolution
	This is for merging multiple channels into one. Which helps to reduce computational complexity. If N channels there, the Kernal will be of size 1X1XN

5. 3X3 Convolution
	3X3 Kernals are widely used in DNN. This is used to extract features from an image in feed forward of an epoch and the weights of kernal will adjust in backward pass.

6. Feature Maps
	Its used for mapping some specific features in an image.
	Consider a feature map search for lines, and the next feature map can look for combination of lines such as rectangles, 
	then upcoming featuremap can able to find the objects using the combination of previous features.

7. Activation Function
	It calculate the weighted sum and find the error in the direction and backpropagate.
	Some of non-linear activation functions are sigmoid, Tanh(hyperbolic tangent), ReLU, PRELU and Leaky ReLU.

8. Receptive Field
	The number of pixels seen by one pixel in a layer.
	Local Receptive field will be the size of kernal, Global receptive field of last layer must be size of the object.
